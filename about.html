            <p>A sleeping herdsmen's cow births a bull calf. <br> This goes back to a story about two herders whose cows simultaneously gave birth to two calves. One gives birth to a bull calf, the other to a heifer calf. While the cow's owner, which had calved a heifer calf, was asleep, his companion substituted it for his bull calf. Unknown to what had occurred, the rightful owner of the heifer calf congratulated his companion on his excellent fortunes and parted ways with his companion's newborn bull calf.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Abdi. I am from Wellington City. I hope you guys enjoy my blog and take away something nurturing with you when you leave. I am an anime fan, especially a good Isekai. I also love reading Manhwa because the artwork is next level. My journey in life has led me to Dev Academy, where I hope to learn new skills and pursue a growth mindset.<br>I came from a small peninsula in the Horn of Africa, similar to the size of New Zealand, with approximately half the population of New Zealand. Somaliland was once part of the British empire as a protectorate when it gained independence on July the 1st, 1960.

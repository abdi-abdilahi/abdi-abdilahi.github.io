            <p>A sleeping herdsmen's cow births a bull calf. <br> This goes back to a story about two herders whose cows simultaneously gave birth to two calves. One gives birth to a bull calf, the other to a heifer calf. While the cow's owner, which had calved a heifer calf, was asleep, his companion substituted it for his bull calf. Unknown to what had occurred, the rightful owner of the heifer calf congratulated his companion on his excellent fortunes and parted ways with his companion's newborn bull calf. Somali farmers/herders consider a heifer calf better than a bull calf since it will give milk and have calves when grown.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Abdi. I am from Wellington City. I hope you guys enjoy my blog and take away something fulfiling and nurturing with you when you leave. I am an anime fan, especially a good Isekai. I also love reading Manhwa because the artwork is next level. I studied at Victoria University of Wellington and did a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Statistics. My next journey in life has led me to Dev Academy, where I hope to learn new skills and pursue a growth mindset.<br>I came from a small peninsula in the Horn of Africa, similar to the size of New Zealand, with approximately half the population of New Zealand. Somaliland was once part of the British empire as a protectorate when it gained independence on July the 1st, 1960.

            <p>Queen Elizabeth Alexandra Mary sent this letter to the people of somaliland on the day of their independence:"I, my Government and my people in the United Kingdom wish you well on this day of independence. The connection between our people goes back some 130 years and the British administration of the Protectorate for 60 years. I look forward to a continuing and enduring friendship between our two countries."</p>

            <h2>Somaliland</h2>
            <p>Somaliland has been inhabited since at least the palaeolithic. During the Stone Age, the Doian and Hargeisan cultures flourished here. The oldest evidence of burial customs in the Horn of Africa comes from cemeteries in Somaliland dating back to the 4th Millenium BCE. The stone implements from the Jalelo site in the north were also characterized in 1909 as essential artefacts demonstrating the archaeological universality during the Paleolithic between the East and the West.</p>
            <p>According to linguists, the first Afroasiatic-speaking populations arrived in the region during the ensuing Neolithic period from the family's proposed Urheimat ("original homeland") in the Nile Valley or the Near East.</p>

            <p>The Laas Geel complex on the outskirts of Somaliland's capital Hargeisa dates back around 5,000 years and has rock art depicting both wild animals and decorated cows. Other cave paintings are found in the northern Dhambalin region, which features one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is in the distinctive Ethiopian-Arabian style, dating to 1,000 to 3,000 BCE. Additionally, between the towns of Las Khorey and El Ayo in eastern Somaliland lies Karinhegane, the site of numerous cave paintings of real and mythical animals. Each image has an inscription below it, which collectively has been estimated to be around 2,500 years old</p>

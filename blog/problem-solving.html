          <h1>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
            For example, 1. were blocked on a simple problem:
          </h1>
          <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            I had just written the pseudocode for the fizzbuzz function on paper and worked through the problem-solving techniques. When I finally decided to code, most of the steps went smoothly, and I followed what I had written on paper. However, I could not figure out why the code was not working for several hours. Turn out I had the conditionals in the wrong order.           
          </p>
        
          <h2>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            I tried several techniques to approach this problem. First, I spent a good deal in pseudocode writing down on paper and making sure that the steps of the code made sense in plain English, like if I was writing down a recipe for how to bake a lemon cake for someone who had never baked before. I would then try the code line by line, read the error messages, and compare it to my pseudocode. Doing this helped me consolidate my pseudocode sentences into more concise and bare-bone instructions by removing unnecessary descriptions and complications.          
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            When I first tried using these techniques, some were challenging, but the more I did it, the easier it got. Seeing the results of my coding made me believe in myself and allowed me to be in a growth mindset.         
          </p>

          <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            I learned from this experience that any problem has a solution, even if it might take some time. How you think about the problem drastically increases the problem solvability. It is essential to have skills in the tools you are using to solve your problem, but I believe it is just as important to believe in yourself and always remain in a growth mindset to be open to learning the tools.          
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1> elegantly solved a problem.</h1>
          <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            I had to figure out a way to remove a word from a list of words. The problem would have been straightforward if they were all the same, but some had different capitalisations of their letters varying in different positions.          
          </p>

          <h2>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            To solve this problem, I used several techniques. First, I broke down the steps of building the function into parts and worked on them individually. Then I tried writing the conjugate of the solution. Ultimately the combination of trying something and googling the methods for the code led me to answer, which surprised me with how small the code was.         
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            After getting to this point, I already had experience using the problem-solving techniques I had learned throughout this sprint. The feeling of frustration became determination and a sense of purpose for cracking the code.         
          </p>

          <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            In this problem, I learned that even if you start with extensive code, you can always shorten it by using different methods and giving more thought to what the function does.         
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h1>

          <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            Pseudocode is one of my favourite problem-solving tools. It's simple to make into a habit and convenient for seeing the big picture of your code. It's like the foundation of a house. I've used this technique throughout sprint four, and it is one I would be deliberately practising every time I code. from a scale of 1 to 10 on how confident I am in using this technique, I would say I am an eight but I would give it a 10/10 for usefulness.          
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Trying something</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            Trying something is another favourite of mind. Trial and error is an innovative tool, especially if combined with the error message. Understanding why something doesn't work is just as valuable as making something work. I give this problem-solving technique 10/10 for its usefulness and confidence in using it.           
          </p>
          <h2>Rubber ducky method</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            Sadly, I have not used this technique and am unable to speak about it without compromising my integrity. But it's similar to writing out your code in pseudocode, but instead, you talk it out to a duck toy. So my confidence in using this technique is sitting at zero, but that might change once I buy a duck toy.          
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Reading error messages</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            This technique is beneficial and is paramount in solving your coding problem. Every problem in coding begins with an error message. There were times when I thought my code did not do the process I intended, and it turned out that I had only used an incorrect syntax. Reading the error message saved me a lot of time writing a code from scratch just by reading the error message. I have not learned how to decipher this mysterious language, but my confidence in using it sits at 6 out of 10.         
          </p>
          <h2>Googling</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            I've been googling since internet connections can be interrupted by a phone call, but since making this sprint, I've learned how to google better. My confidence sits at a solid 9 for this technique          
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Console.logging</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            This technique helped shape my code writing as it helped me see what I have written in code. It is a beneficial tool in problem-solving. my confidence in using this tool sits at about 7          
          </p>

          <h2>Asking your peers for help</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            Asking a peer for help is a working progress for me. My confidence is slowly building, but at the moment, it is sitting at 4 for this technique, and it is primarily due to finding the confidence to do it         
           </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Asking coaches for help</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            Asking coaches for help is work progress for me I think my confidence is slowly building on asking my coaches for help. My spirit is at 4 for this technique, mainly due to finding the confidence to do it. 
          </p>        
          <h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            This technique has helped me a lot because reflecting on what I have learned has taught me more about myself and connects me to what I am learning more deeply. In addition, it has allowed me to be more open to a growth mindset and practice the techniques I am learning more deliberately.          
          </p>

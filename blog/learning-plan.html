              <h3>Commitments and Epectations.</h3>
              <p> The commitment I make while studying at Dev Academy is to follow the guidelines and trust in the philosophy of just-in-time learning. I will always ask for help when I need it and give support to others when I can. I will always be kind, respectful and compassionate when giving feedback. When I feel overwhelmed and the workload builds up, I will take a step back and ask for and seek help. I will ask for help in my home group. When that fails, I will use the #help channel on discord, and if this fails, I will contact my homegroup facilitator(s) and ask for help. The expectations I carry from my home facilitator(s) are the commitment that they are kind and respectful when giving me feedback, to be available to hold me accountable for my work and to be a guide in this jungle of web developing landscape. If I fall behind by more than a day's work, I will immediately seek help as this will avoid a backlog of other work. as I have experienced during the current sprint.

                During the day, I pray five times, in an interval of the natural progression of the day. I am committed to these prayer times because they form the pillars of my religion, and most of them can happen at home. However, the Friday prayer is the most important one in Islam, and this prayer is performed at the mosque every Friday from 12 pm to 1:30 pm. Therefore, besides the abovementioned commitments, my schedule is free to pursue my learning.

              <h2>Stength, limitations and Core Skills</h2>
              <p> 
                My strengths are creativity and problem-solving. I developed these strengths throughout my education at Victoria university while studying Mathematics. Mathematical problems in my classes required not just an analytical approach but also a creative one. I learned that sometimes when approaching a problem, the solution, although analytical, requires you to think outside the box. That lateral thinking over my time at Victoria university has thought me think creatively. My learning limitation is that I often overthink a problem and forget to break it down to simplify the question. Overthinking makes me frustrated and overwhelmed, and when that happens, I start doubting myself and wonder if I can learn. 
                What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
                The human skill I would like to develop during my time at dev academy is to have a growth mindset in the ability to communicate ideas. 
                The skill to engage in a team and contribute without fear of judgement or drowning in the group dynamics, and how to look introspectively, build confidence in my abilities, and not second guess myself.

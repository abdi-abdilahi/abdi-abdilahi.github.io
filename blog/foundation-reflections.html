          <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
              My values and principles come from by religious belief 
              In the past my ego would prevent me from trying my best to learn something new because it would threaten me with failure and all the shame it comes with it.
              I learned how to recognise my ego and quite my critic long enough to be productive.

          <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

          <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            It is because learning the core skills helps develop your emotional intelligence and allows the students to build interpersonal tools to cope with the high-stress, intensity-driven learning style in the Bootcamp and, along the way, develop tools that are transferable in your professional career.

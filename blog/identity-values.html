          <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>

            I worked in a sports vibe kiwi pub with a gaming room as a duty manager. My role was but was not limited to ensuring the liquor Act was not in breach. However, since there is a gaming room in the pub, I was required to identify anyone who showed any symptoms of gambling addiction and log it into an incident book kept at the bar. I would do my regular 15-minute checks and discreetly write down the appearance or the name of the person I taught who showed genuine gambling problems. A month later, I asked my boss if we used any information we had written down in the incident book to reduce harmful gambling. He told me that what we are doing with the incident book is only there to protect the trust in charge of the gambling machines so that the harm they are causing the communities doesn’t seem like it’s their fault. What shocked me was when I asked if it was okay to refuse entry of someone who I think has a gambling problem into the venue, my boss met me with disapproval, and it almost got me fired from the job. It was tough for me to consolidate the idea of monitoring harmful gambling so meticulously, and the lack of action by the owners to regulate the danger of problem gambling at their venue made me feel dishonest and cruel. So I decided to stay quiet and play by their rules. At the time, I was jobless, and this was the first venue with an offer. If I were to make this decision again, I would not compromise my honesty and compassion for a job.

          <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            I tried several techniques to approach this problem. First, I spent a good deal in pseudocode writing down on paper and making sure that the steps of the code made sense in plain English, like if I was writing down a recipe for how to bake a lemon cake for someone who had never baked before. I would then try the code line by line, read the error messages, and compare it to my pseudocode. Doing this helped me consolidate my pseudocode sentences into more concise and bare-bone instructions by removing unnecessary descriptions and complications.

          <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            My strengths are my love of learning, which allows me to remain engaged through the process of dev academy. Taking an interest in ongoing experience for its own sake and exploring and discovering new skills will motivate me during my journey. Creativity is my strength and allows me to think of novel and productive ways to conceptualise the material.

          <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            I learned from this experience that any problem has a solution, even if it might take some time. How you think about the problem drastically increases the problem solvability. It is essential to have skills in the tools you are using to solve your problem, but I believe it is just as important to believe in yourself and always remain in a growth mindset to be open to learning the tools.

          <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            In my first year of university I was placed in group to work on a project involving critical thinking in text analysis. We had to pick an article in a journal or a body of text that was published. The choosing of the body of text was our first decision we had to make as a group and immediately there were disagreement in the group in which body of text to pick. I had stayed away from expressing my opinion in the situation as I had no preference in the choose of the text as long as the work got done. From what I cam remember the group came to a discussion but there were. Certain individuals that were not happy with the body of text choice. This caused the said individuals to withdraw from engaging in the group when I came to meet ups and working together. My abilities in resolving conflicts and purposing a resolution at the time was terrible so I stayed out ig the group politics and did my part of the project. This strategy was clearly ineffective as it had no achievements it all in resolving any tensions in the group. Thinking back to it now, I would take a more active participation, and tried to purpose a fair way of choosing a body text like placing all the choices in a box and randomly drawing one out so everyone felt like their idea was equally valid and had an equal chance of being drawn from the box.

          <h2>Why is EQ important?.</h2>
          <p class="text-content">IQ is believed by the majority of experts as an essential element of success when pursuing academic achievement, which often leads to higher-paying jobs, and healthier lives. However, today's experts recognise it is not the only determinant of life success. Living a healthy and fulfiling life requires a person to also have a good EQ. in today's job market, many companies are looking for someone with a healthy EQ. </p>

          <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
          <p class="text-content"> IQ measures how well a person uses visual and spatial processing, fluid reasoning, and quantitative reasoning. Their knowledge of the world and how well their working memory and short-term memory work. Where EQ measures how well someone can identify and control their emotions, perceive and evaluate how others feel, and use emotion to facilitate social communication and relate to others.
          </p>
          <p class="text-content">Having a high EQ helps you understand the person you are, which can profoundly affect your learning and networking. Instead of focusing on a single, general intelligence, usually called the g factor, some experts believe that the ability to understand and express emotion can play an equal, if not more important, role in having a healthier, happy life. 
            My understanding of EQ can recognise your and others' emotional state and be present. I believe this behaviour allows so many successful people to achieve their goals and stay productive. In addition, a sound EQ gives you the tools to be an effective and impactful leader.

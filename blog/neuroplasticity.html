          <h2>What is Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            Neuroplasticity is the idea of rewiring our brains to learn new behaviours, skills and cognitive functioning. Our brains are like clay moulds that you can shape into anything. It's malleable and allows us to organise connections between neurons selectively.         
           </p>
          <p class="text-content">
            Experts have shown that knowing your brain is malleable can positively affect our learning. In addition, the principles of neuroplasticity can benefit students learning by deepening the neuron connection pathways and making stronger connections using deliberate practice.

          <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your use.</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            For example, whenever I do something new, I tell myself that if I don't get it now, I will eventually. Doing this gives me time to reorganise the data into a different context. In addition, it helps me understand the root of my overstanding. Another technique to make your brain more malleable is by reviewing the material in intervals to build more robust thicker connections and, of course, practising every chance you get.          
          </p>
          <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            You can increase your neuroplasticity by learning a new skill, like an instrument. In addition, experts have shown that regular physical exercise can improve your neuroplasticity. Committing to engaging in learning new things often builds stronger neuropathways, and exercising helps to destress your brain from the work of discovering new superpowers. Watching this clip helped me understand what neuroplasticity is and how to use it for a positive <a id="res-links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXoErccq0vw">change in your life</a>.

          <h2>What is a Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            A growth mindset is aligning your inner voice with the possibilities of growth and, in this process, reaching your most authentic self. A growth mindset is essential because it helps us achieve our goals and focuses our intentions from a learning perspective.

          <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            The most surprising element of a growth mindset is its required self-awareness. Growing up, my father read a lot and would take me to the library every chance he got, but I wouldn't say I liked reading much, and in my adulthood, this led to the belief that I'm not a good reader. So when I read a book, it would take me a while to finish it, or I would become disinterested and stop reading it after a few chapters. What changed for me now is knowing the contrary to be true.          
          </p>        
          <h2>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
          <p class="text-content">
            My understanding is that my brain is always asking questions and trying to make predictions about its environment. Learning a new skill takes an immense amount of focus and energy. In each step of my learning journey, I will remind myself when I am agitated and feel like giving up. Instead, think of it as the circulation of chemicals, the brain and nervous system telling itself it is time to pay attention and change. At the point of agitation is where the edge of learning is. Here is some good material for pursuing a growth mindset by <a id="res-links" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1BwF7XkkuM">Jay Shetty</a>.
